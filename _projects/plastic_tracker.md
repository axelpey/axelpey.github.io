Plastic is ubiquitous, but that is not a reason to stop caring about what happens to a piece trash you see on the ground. To make people more aware of where a piece of trash can go and pollute, I invented the Plastic Tracker, an interactive map that lets you see see where plastic goes in the ocean from where you are on the globe.

It has been used so far by more than 200k users.
